# quoteGenerator
This is a quote generator in which asynchronous requests are made.
1- The DOM is manipulated;
2- Interesting things are used such as the Math.random() function;
3- The Math.floor() function it is used because I wanted to round down numbers in order to return the largest integer;
4- The class.List property is used to access the class of an element;
5- And, the "await" operator is implemented to wait for a promise. Remember that the "await" operator can only be used within an asynchronous function.
